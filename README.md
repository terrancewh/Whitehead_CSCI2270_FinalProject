# Whitehead_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:

This project will take into account flights from Colorado to international destinations and the cost and time associated with each flight. Costs based on August 1st's cheapest online roundtrip tickets will be implemented in the graph data structure as well as the time each flight takes. From a menu, users will be able to determine the flights that take the least amount of time to an international destination, including layovers as well as the cheapest paths. Within each destination there will be a doubly linked list data structure to represent the most populated cities, which can be traveled to by taxi. Users will be able to determine how soon and how costly it will be to arrive at a destination, and furthermore the time it will take via taxi to arrive. Users will be able to update the graph and linked list destinations for their own location preferences.

How to Run:
In order to run the program, users will need to download the main.cpp file, Graph.h file, and Graph.cpp file. Using Codeblocks, users can create a project and form the right directories (an include file with Graph.h inside and src file with Graph.cpp inside) before running the program. Alternatively, users can just run mainwithcppandh.cpp in codeblocks.

Dependencies:
This program has no dependencies. However, if users want to input information about flights and airports, they are suggested to google flight routes and the costs and times associated with this.

System Requirements:
This program is primarily for Windows users.

Open issues/bugs:
For some reason, trying to run the main.cpp, Graph.h, and Graph.cpp file together does not always work. I think it is the directories of my folder in codeblocks, so there should be no problem for other users. If there are any issues however, use the mainwithcppandh.cpp file and it will work. This file always runs for me.
