# Whitehead_CSCI2270_FinalProject

//This project will take into account flights from Colorado to international destinations and the cost and time associated with each flight. Costs based on August 1st's cheapest online tickets will be implemented in the graph data structure as well as the time each flight takes. From a menu, users will be able to determine the flights that take the least amount of time to an international destination, including layovers as well as the first and second cheapest paths (for flexibility). Within each destination there will be a doubly linked list data structure to represent some subway system destinations, as well as the times associated with each(or driving times if a subway/train system is not applicable). Users will be able to determine how soon and how costly it will be to arrive at a destination, as well as update the graph and linked list destinations for their own location preferences.
